A suite of visual tools for music lovers, integrated with Last.fm and Spotify APIs. This project generates aesthetic reports ("receipts"), listening statistics, and music compatibility analysis, optimized for social sharing (Instagram Stories).

This repository is a **Monorepo** hosting three distinct tools in subdirectories, serving both the main domain and its subdomains.

## ⚠️ Security & API Usage

This project relies on client-side calls to public APIs (Last.fm & Spotify).

API Keys: API Keys used in frontend JavaScript are publicly visible by design.

**Important for Forks:**

- Please generate your own API Keys via the Last.fm API Console and Spotify for Developers.

- NEVER commit a Spotify **"Client Secret"** to a public repository. If backend authentication is needed, use environment variables or a server-side proxy.

- Be mindful of API rate limits.

## 🛡️ Privacy & Analytics

This project integrates **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** to track anonymous usage statistics (e.g., popular report formats, screen resolution, and error rates).

- **For Users:** No personal data (such as Last.fm session keys or passwords) is stored or sent to Google. We only track interaction events to improve the tools. See our [Privacy Policy](https://auvlyfm.github.io/privacy.html).

- **For Developers/Forks:** The GA tracking script is included in the HTML files. **If you fork this repository, please remove or replace the Google Analytics script tag** in the `<head>` of all HTML files. Failing to do so will send your development/testing data to the official AuvlyFM analytics dashboard.

## 🚀 Deployment & Workflow

This project utilizes a direct-to-production workflow tailored for Hostinger:

- Development: Edits are made directly in the Hostinger environment (or local setup).

- Version Control: Changes are pushed from the server terminal to GitHub for backup/versioning.
